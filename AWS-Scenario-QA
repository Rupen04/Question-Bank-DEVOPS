Cost-Saving & Performance Optimization
Scenario 1: You need to optimize a highly transactional system hosted on AWS to reduce costs while improving performance. Describe a cost-effective strategy to move from Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) to General Purpose SSD (gp3) volumes. How would you ensure minimal performance degradation during this transition?
Solution:

STEP 1 — Analyze Current Performance
Before touching storage, gather real I/O metrics from CloudWatch:
VolumeReadOps
VolumeWriteOps
VolumeReadBytes
VolumeWriteBytes
BurstBalance (if gp2 was involved)
VolumeQueueLength
VolumeThroughputPercentage
Because most io1 volumes are over-provisioned. You often only need 5–40% of the IOPS you pay for.

STEP 2 — Right-Size gp3 IOPS and Throughput
Choose gp3 settings based on what the system actually uses (not the io1 provisioned value).
Example:
io1 provisioned: 10,000 IOPS
Actual CloudWatch usage: 2,000–4,000 IOPS, peaks at 5,000
gp3 provisioning:
5,500 IOPS
250 MB/s throughput
Cost drops 70–80% while performance stays above peak needs.

STEP 3 — Convert io1 → gp3 Using "Modify Volume" (Online, No Downtime)
AWS EBS supports online volume modification.
Go to EC2 → Elastic Block Store → Volumes
Select the io1 volume
Choose Actions → Modify Volume
Change:
Volume Type → gp3
Set provisioned IOPS and Throughput
Apply changes
No reboot, no detaching, and no downtime.
EBS will enter a modifying state but volume stays available and performance is maintained.

STEP 4 — Monitor During the Transition
Use CloudWatch & CloudWatch Logs:
Check VolumeModification events
Validate IOPS and throughput
Ensure no increase in:
VolumeQueueLength
Latency metrics (VolumeTotalReadTime, VolumeTotalWriteTime)
If performance dips:
You can instantly boost gp3 IOPS/MBps (still cheaper than io1).

STEP 5 — Validate at Application Layer
Run synthetic or real load tests:
High TPS tests
Database write-intensive operations
Query latency checks
Batch vs. real-time workload patterns
